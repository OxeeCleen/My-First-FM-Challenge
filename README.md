## My process

- Downloaded the required resources  
- Reviewed the material  
- Used the design desktop/mobile images as a visual reference  

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code  
- Google Fonts  
- Custom CSS Properties  
- Windows Snipping Tool (for solution screenshots)

### What I learned

- It's okay to figure things out on your own.  
- Without `height:` there is no vertical centering.  
- Edge and Firefox can be very different in product results.  

### Continued development

- I would like to learn more about upsizing responsive development.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) — Great resource for many development languages. For this project, I looked up HSL since I normally use RGB and box-shadow.

### AI Collaboration

- I used MS Copilot to help with Figma (download, install, how to open files, close files).
